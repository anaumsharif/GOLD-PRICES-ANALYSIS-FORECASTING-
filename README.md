# GOLD-PRICES-ANALYSIS-FORECASTING-
The forecasting algorithm ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is founded on the notion that past values of the time series alone can be utilized to predict future values
The goal of this project is to analyze the price of gold. 
The price of gold is volatile, they change rapidly with time. 
Our main Aim of this project will be to predict the price of gold per unit. 
This model is created to predict the future prices so that gold can be bought and sold at profitable positions and reduce the risk of investment
Machine learning forecasting is a process that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions about future events.
